Here we will discuss about voltage and its basic physics, the point is not to go very deep in mathematics but to take the overview.

- Voltage - It is a potential differenece between two points. For electronics it is the potential difference between two points in a circuit, we generally take other point to be ground for sake of simplicity.

- Represented as -- V_ab = (V_a - V_b) -- means (potential at point a - potential at point b).
