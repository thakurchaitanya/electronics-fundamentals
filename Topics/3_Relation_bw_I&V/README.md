Crudely speaking, the name of the game is to make and use gadgets that have interesting and useful I-versus V characteristics.

- In Resistors (I simply proportional to V)
- In capacitors (I proportional to rate of change of V)
- In diodes (I flows in only one direction)
- Transistors are three-terminal devices in which the current that can flow between a pair of terminals is controlled by the volt age applied to a third terminal
