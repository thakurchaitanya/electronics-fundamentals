# electronics-fundamentals
This repository documents my practical learning journey through core electronics concepts.

Inspired by The Art of Electronics by Paul Horowitz & Winfield Hill.

For each topic, I:
- Study theory
- Build circuits (breadboard / hardware)
- Simulate when required
- Perform calculations
- Observe real-world behavior
- Document learnings

## Topics
- Voltage
- Current
- Relation between current(I) and voltage(V)
- Resistance and Resistor
-
